# LST (We will do the following step by step.)
## Code
There's a lot of redundancy and experimental documentation in the code now. We will clean it up step by step and give detailed instructions, including data preparation, model training and testing.
## Environment
We will sort out the environment requirements and publish the docker image.
## Model
We will make further adjustments to the parameters, and then upload the pre-trained model.

## todo
* [ ] add instruction
* [ ] add environment requirements
* [ ] add docker image
* [ ] add pretrained model
